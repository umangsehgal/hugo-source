_Productonomics is written by me, Umang Sehgal. I am based in San Francisco, CA, and am a proud University of Washington alum!_

I currently work at Okta, Inc where I am focused on engineering programs, release strategy, developer relations, and improving the CI/CD pipeline for Okta Identity Cloud. I did my bachelors in Computer Science at the LNMIIT (Jaipur, IN) and went on to pursue my MS degree from University of Washington with a focus on data science and human-centered design.

I have been writing Productonomics since 2019, and it has been a pleasure to connect to like minded people through this medium.
