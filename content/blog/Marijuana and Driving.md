## Introduction
Since recreational marijuana use was legalized in 2012 in Washington and 2014 in Colorado, several states have joined this movement and legalized Marijuana. Most recently, Illinois became the 11th state to legalize such use in May of 2019. There have been a variety of debates and concerns raised about marijuana use while driving. Little to no research exists on the impacts of cannabis on drivers, making assessing the dangers of such behavior impossible. Based on polling results from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 50% of recreational marijuana users believe that it is safe to drive while under the influence of cannabis, whereas only 14% of nonusers agree. It is very difficult to measure the exact amount of THC in one’s system, the psychoactive substance from smoking marijuana, by simple blood testing. Usually the impairment is observed for two to three hours after smoking; whereby an hour after smoking the peak THC levels have declined 80% - 90%.   

## Experiment Design
Drug-induced driving impairment isn’t quite the same as quantifying blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) in an approved approach to determine the clinical relevance of findings for traffic safety. Some elements of cannabis use are similar though. Potency of strain affects potency of effect. Marijuana and its active ingredient – THC – alter brain function, affecting processes like attention, perception and coordination, which are necessary for a complex behavior like driving a car. Smoked marijuana produces a rapid spike in THC concentrations in the blood, followed by a decline as the drug redistributes to tissues, including the brain.
But unlike alcohol, evidence of cannabis use can linger long after its effects have worn off, particularly if people are regular users or consume a lot in a single episode. Among chronic users, it may not clear out of their systems for weeks. Therefore, unlike blood alcohol concentration, the presence and amount of different cannabis compounds in the blood or urine do not necessarily tell you whether the driver is impaired due to marijuana. Additionally, most of the research shows that smoking marijuana would only affect a specific number of driving-related skills, such as slow reaction time and lane position variability for example, which is another factor to consider in our study.

## Understanding Bias in current approach: 

A 2018 meta-analysis of two dozen studies, published in Frontiers in Pharmacology, found that "publication bias was very high," meaning studies that find marijuana increases crash risk are much more likely to see print than studies that don't, and that the overall association "is not statistically significant." By contrast, a 2019 meta-analysis published in The Canadian Journal of Addiction, based on a smaller set of studies, calculated a statistically significant odds ratio of about 2.5, representing a 150 percent risk increase.
The two reports very well prove the misuse of the word “statistical significance” and there is no proof to the fact that the researchers took into account age, gender, race/ethnicity, and alcohol use. Also, a few simulator studies have shown that performance is no longer affected two or three hours after smoking pot, although THC can still be detected by blood tests at that point. Last but not the least - what they report as a marijuana effect might well be a young man effect.

## Defining Impaired Driving: 
The NHTSA breaks down the list of visual cues into four major categories of driving behavior:
1.	Problems maintaining proper lane position - failure to stay within one's driving lane on the road.
2.	Speed and braking difficulties - failure to maintain proper speed, sudden acceleration and braking.
3.	Vigilance problems - failure to pay attention to the surroundings and changing driving conditions.
4.	Judgment problems - inability to judge the road and proximity to objects, such as jerky or sharp turns, sudden movements and over-correction of steering.

## Recruiting Participants: 
1.	Subjects would be sought who have never experienced a license suspension or other driving-related convictions in the prior ten years. 
2.	Need a large sample size, at least 400, with 100 in each group (cannabis, alcohol, control groups)
3.	At each site where consumption is legal, participants would be recruited by means of a one-page flyer that will be distributed by instructors in these programs. The flyer would explain that this was being conducted as part of a study, offered prospective participants the opportunity to express their opinions about sanctions for drug-impaired driving, explained that participation was voluntary and that information disclosed would be kept strictly confidential, and promised a financial incentive for participating.
4.	History of driving offenses, age, gender, race/ethnicity, alcohol use, and frequency of consumption would also be considered as disclosures. 

## Conduct of the Experiment:
1.	Benchmarking Sobriety: DriveWise provides driver training in multiple cities and we figured that it would be the closest one could get to actual driving. This simulator should be tried out sober by the control group, to give a baseline, to understand driving behavior and not bring in bias.
2.	Baseline Blood Test: Conduct a sober blood test. Be sure to check if the baseline would pick up any THC since participants might consume weed frequently and might have vaped the night before. 
3.	Vape weed / Alcohol: To simulate the experiment to reflect real life usage, let the participants in the cannabis group ingest a substance that contains 20 percent THC, which is on the higher end of the spectrum. Furthermore, have the alcohol group raise their alcohol-blood level to 0.1. Ask the participants questions: How high does he/she feel out of 10, would he/she risk driving at this point in time given a particular situation? 
4.	Blood test and Driving Simulator: Conduct the blood test on both groups, and also observe traffic violations on the driving simulator. Note that the simulator isn’t a scientific means of measuring cannabis impairment—and you can potentially improve each time just by getting more used to it.
5.	Standardized field sobriety test: After about an hour after vaping, have a former police officer and drug recognition expert perform a standardized field sobriety test on the subject. Conduct evaluations based on a set of “clues” that would indicate impairment. If the subject exhibited too many clues, that would be grounds for arrest for instance refusing to take the test is grounds for a criminal charge.
6.	Walk and turn test: A typical test very often conducted involves the participant to take nine heel-to-toe steps along a line of tape on the floor. After the ninth step, the subject had to use one foot to turn around and then take another nine steps back. Once started, the participant wasn’t allowed to stop.
7.	Final blood test: For the final validation, the subject could also take another blood test at the conclusion of the evaluation. This would take place about two and a half hours after they finish vaping.
8.	Results: Compare the number of violations (“clues” ) in each group. Having a large sample size will help increase the power of the experiment. 

## Conclusion
Even when we’ve identified which abilities correlate most strongly with driving performance, there are several other challenges to deal with. For instance: Not all of cannabis effects will overlap with those of alcohol, or painkillers, or sleep deprivation. What's more, the skills required to operate a car safely—like gauging the speed and position of other drivers, recognizing the sensitivity of your vehicle's brakes, checking your blind spots before changing lanes—are different from the abilities required to perform those skills—dynamic visual acuity, normal motor function, and focus.
