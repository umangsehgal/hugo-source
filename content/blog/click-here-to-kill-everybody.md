~A long due book review~

Click Here to Kill Everybody opens with three incidents where hackers take command of systems ranging from printers to power plants solely to demonstrate their potential and to prove the exploitability of the interdependence within the internet. One of the incidents highlighted Russian hackers coming into a Ukrainian power plant through a malware and remotely controlling the center’s computer and turning its power off. Essentially being able to diminish trust in socio-economic systems at scale. Take the last scenario, which gives the book its title, a “bioprinter” that is hacked to print a “killer virus” and eventually does.

That brings a strong question - Why doesn’t the government/ power organizations cumulatively improve on cyber-security initiatives? Schneier argues that the positioning of cybersecurity as an investment isn’t lucrative enough for large companies with few competitors. Schneier further argues that individuals must themselves do their best to take secure measures despite the government taking steps to protect with encryption, anonymity and other initiatives.

A Harvard fellow and the CTO of IBM Resilient (IBM’s Incident Response Unit) - Schneier is also the author of several other cyber security books. He is particularly known for putting cybersecurity in the context of the market and proposing policies around it. Schneier has coined the term “Internet+” (Internet + Things+ Us) in this book where he separates the term “Internet” throughout the book to illustrate the inter-connectivity which was more peripheral in the past and now has the power (if misused) to kill us. He identifies strength in claiming that the security of the Internet+ won’t get better anytime soon and proposes ten design principles to improve the security of this Internet+ while emphasizing on the fact that even the old and standard security fundamentals have not yet been properly implemented!

Schneier points out the need to disconnect systems, which could potentially pose to be a weakness of this book. He claims that a connected device is a device that can be attacked and that ensuring the security of Internet+ is dependent on ensuring the security of these links more than the components themselves. As we know this is not how profitable organizations work today and would require massive re-organization across industries and governments to comply with the protocols and processes being proposed before venturing into building products that instant prove secure. However, as a reader I can empathize with the insecurity within the ‘Emerging Internet+’ that Schneier talks about.

Schneier does not just limit the contents to policy and regulation enforcement by governments. To create the 'secure Internet+' he suggests developing both principles and rules, promoting public education, correcting information asymmetries, funding research and closing the skills gap. One of strongest points in his book is the belief that governments should "demilitarize" the internet by shifting the focus to strengthen the resilience of the infrastructure rather than being offensive about it. He further argues for international cooperation, since no one country can hope to change a global infrastructure. Although, it is imperative to note that this will trade away some ability to innovate and Schneier does bring that to attention.

Schneier stands out in mapping astounding parallels to how society (or rather the administration) has previously dealt with technological revolutions. He maps air travel becoming the safest mode of transport owing to the safety regulations put in place and enforces that federal agencies must similarly take responsibility to protect the public from life threatening cyber-attacks. He further promotes that software production should be overseen by licensed software engineers endowed with the responsibility to ensure that accessible apps can withstand a reasonable level of threat, similar to the construction architects affirming that a building will endure strength in all weathers.

In this book, Schneier operates on the “peak indifference” theory which attempts at convincing people during the early stage of crisis that the itself crisis exists. As things haven’t taken a worse form yet there isn’t much to worry about at the moment, however the people/organizations who currently profit from the existing state of affairs will make full efforts to convince the society about the ethicality of their actions. Essentially, he aims at convincing people that isn’t late to do something about the upcoming crisis.  

There definitely is some hope though, as Schneier points out in the book. He sees the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as “a sea change in privacy law.” He believes it is a “reasonable blueprint” for what the EU might do with respect to internet security and safety. Which is a relief from his certainty towards “surveillance capitalism” not being sustainable, and remarks that we are starting to get hurt with the extraction of data about both our public and private lives. No security is going to improve on its own, as neither the market will impose restrictions, nor the government will act without much obvious serious damage. Schneier brings out prominently the need to engage in multiple stakeholder policy by including technologists, users and private actors in the process, and to attract their expertise into the public sector.

Finally, I feel the book is a deep reflection on trust, sociotechnical systems and the future of crime. Even though we are still far away from a single app that can be clicked to kill everything, the book does justice in making a case that unless pre-emptive action is taken, the scary reality is not far away. The book aptly serves as a wake-up call to most of us who are pretentious victims of not just ‘information security’ but also ‘life threatening risks’. The book is useful for any user who might have a naive understanding of the Internet of Things but particularly for those who are the minds behind privacy, human-rights, security and concerned topics.
